# AutoWave
1.This is the pytorch realization of "Regularizing autoencoders with wavelet transform for sequence anomaly detection".

2.Take ECG dataset as an example, run data_preparation.py first to perform data preparation, then run main_ECG.py to train AutoWave and make inference.Finally, run post_process to calculate relevant metrics.

3.To use your own dataset and save the correspoinding results, replace datapath and inpath in main file with your own directories.
